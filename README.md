# TiCons CLI [](http://appcelerator.com/titanium/) [![Appcelerator Alloy](http://www-static.appcelerator.com/badges/alloy-git-badge-sq.png)](http:/appcelerator.com/alloy/)
 
Command-line and CommonJS module version of [TiCons](http://ticons.fokkezb.nl) to generate icons and splash screens (aka launch images) for [Appcelerator](http://appcelerator.com) [Titanium](http://appcelerator.com/titanium) & [Alloy](http://appcelerator.com/alloy) apps.

> **NOTE:** In Titanium 5.0 the `DefaultIcon.png` was introduced. See [DefaultIcon](#defaulticon) for how TiCons handles this.

## Prerequisites

* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php)

## Install [![npm](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/ticons.png)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ticons)

As global CLI:

```
[sudo] npm install -g ticons
```

As a dependency in your projects `package.json`:

```
{
  "name": "your-project",
  "dependencies": {
    "ticons": "*"
  }
}
```

## Quick Start
TiCons can be used both as CLI and CommonJS module.

### CLI
Hit `ticons -h` for full usage, but thanks to [Smart Defaults](#smart-defaults) this will work in most cases:

- Detects if the CWD contains a classic or Alloy project, what platforms are targeted and then generates required icons using `iphone/iTunesArtwork@2x` as input:

     ```
     ~/myproject $ ticons icons
     ```

- Detects if the CWD contains a classic or Alloy project, what platforms are targeted, if the app is locked to one orientation and then generates required splashes using `Default-Portrait-736h@3x.png` as input. If Android is targetted, 9-Patch images will be generated and the required `theme.xml` created for you if missing.

     ```
     ~/myproject ticons splashes
     ```

- Detects if the CWD contains a classic or Alloy project, what platforms are targeted and then generates missing asset densities `iphone/images` as input. If both iOS and Android MDPI are targetted, `images` is used for both iOS and Android MDPI.

     ```
     ~/myproject ticons assets
     ```
          
You can specify diferent input (`ticons icons myIcon.png`) and options to override the defaults for fine-tune the results to your liking.

### Module
For the module use the full option names as properties in the first argument. Specify a callback that accepts an error and result as the second argument.

```
var ticons = require('ticons');

ticons.icons({
	input: 'icon.png',
	outputDir: 'foo',
	platforms: ['ipad','android'],
	classic: true
}, function (err, output) {
	
	if (err) {
		throw err;
	}
	
	console.log('generated files: ' + output.join(', '));
});
```

## Smart defaults
If the `outputDir` (or `-d` or CWD if missing) contains a project, *TiCons* will figure out lots of smart defaults:

- If the project is classic instead of Alloy.
- What platforms are targetted (`<deployment-targets>`).
- If the app is locked to one orientation (`UISupportedInterfaceOrientations` etc.).
- The SDK version used (for [DefaultIcon](#defaulticon)).

In the CLI, you can add the `trace` (`-t`) option to see exactly what configuration is used based on your options and the smart defaults.

## Splashes

### Storyboard Launch Screens

Since 0.21 TiCons can also generate `LaunchLogo*.png` files that Titanium can use to generate storyboard launch images. Since Titanium falls back to `DefaultIcon*.png` for this you only need these if you want it to be different from your app icon. Just add the `--storyboard` option to have TiCons generate Launch Logos instead of regular splash images.

### 9-Patch
By default *TiCons* generated [9-Patch splashes](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Icons_and_Splash_Screens-section-29004897_IconsandSplashScreens-Androidsplashscreenconsiderations) for Android. You can disable this using `--no-nine` (`-n`) option.

Understand that *TiCons* will fit your input image inside the `not-long-port-?` dimensions and then add 9-Patch black pixels to indicate that only the outer most line of pixels on each side should be stretched. For best results use a square image of 1600x1600 pixels that includes the minimal amount of padding, making sure that the outer most pixels are all of the same color.

Since 0.6.0 the generated images are named `background.9.png` so that if you don't use a custom theme and build against Titanium 3.3.0.GA or later the splash will automatically be loaded. If you're using a custom theme, please [see the docs](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/latest/#!/guide/Icons_and_Splash_Screens-section-29004897_IconsandSplashScreens-Androidsplashscreenconsiderations) on how to use the generated splash background. Also make sure the assets `android` directory does not contain any old splashes, because else they will take precendece.

### Cropping
By default on all platforms and on all with `--no-nine`, the input image will be first resized to cover the target dimension and then cropped to fit exactly. For best results use a 2208x2208 image that has its main artwork in the center 1100x1100 pixels. Anything outside of that box might be cropped depending on the width/height ratio of the target splashes.

### Containing
Since 0.10.0 if you give `--width <width>` and `--height <height>` then TiCons will try not to crop that area, taken from the centre of the input image. This will let you *protect* the main content (logo) of the image. Depending on the size of your input image, it might not be possible to both contain this content as well as fit in the input image. In that case, it will give a warning telling you what the size of the input image needs to be and then continue to still crop as usual.

### Filling
Use `--no-crop` (`-c`) to resize the input image to fit instead of cover the target dimension. The remaining area is then filled by repeating the outer most lines of pixels on each side, basically simulating 9-Patch, but then for all platforms. For best results, see the best practice for 9-Patch and use an image of at least 2208x2208 pixels.

### Locale
You can use the `locale` (`-l`) option to specify a 2-letter locale. Only splashes supporting locale paths will be generated when you use this option.

### Fix or not to Fix
By default, some errors in the Appcelerator specs related to iOS and Android splash screen dimensions are fixed. Use `-no-fix` to disable this.

## Icons

### Radius
If you use the `iTunesArtwork@2x` as input for Android and other platforms icons, you might want to round the corners a bit as only iOS does this for you. Simply pass a percentage between `0` and `50` to `--radius` (`-r`). Seems like `18` is about what it was for iOS6.

### DefaultIcon
Since Titanium 5.0 you no longer need to provide all required iOS icon sizes. A single `DefaultIcon.png` in the root of your project will do. In Titanium 5.1 support for Windows was added. You can have a platform specific `DefaultIcon-ios.png` or `DefautlIcon-windows.png` as well, since for iOS it needs to be 24-bit (no alpha).

TiCons will automatically generate the right icons based on the `sdk-version` option. It defaults to the SDK version found in your `tiapp.xml` or else the latest. If you have only iOS or Windows as the target platforms for your project/TiCons it will add the platform-specific suffix to the filename.

## Assets
The `assets` command is assumes the following directories:

- `iphone/images` for iOS Retina (`@2x`) and HD Retina (`@3x`).
- `images` for iOS non-retina, Android MDPI and other platforms.
- `android/images/res-*` for other Android densities.

Just run `ticons assets` in your project root and it will use (HD) Retina images or Android `xxxhdpi` or `xxhdpi` images to generate the others, unless the target image is newer, a 9-patch version is found or the target dpi is higher then the input.

You can also point to a specific image or directory by adding an argument like `ticons assets Resources/images/iphone`. TiCons will try to determine the input dpi based on the location.

### Use any input and output
Since 0.22 you can now set the exact input DPI with the `--orig-dpi` option, the input file or folder no longer needs to be under the output and if the output path ends with `Resources` or `assets`, TiCons will work relative to that. This allows you to use any input and write to any output, e.g.:

	ticons assets ./my-hires-images ./app/widgets/my-widget/assets --orig-dpi @3x

## Widgets
You can also run `ticons assets` in a widget root, which will cause TiCons to read the target platforms from `widget.json` instead of `tiapp.xml`.
